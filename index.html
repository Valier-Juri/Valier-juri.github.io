<p>I am a master student at the University of California, San Diego, pursuing my master degree of data science. My primary interests in data science and mathematics lie in the areas of Graph Theory and Geometry.</p>

<p>I am also passionate about Human-Computer Interaction and Explainable Machine Learning. I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree at University of Wisconsin-Madison and used to work at the <a href="https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/">People and Robot Laboratory</a> under the guidance of <a href = "https://vision.wisc.edu/staff/yaxin_hu/">Yaxin Hu</a> and Prof. <a href = "http://bilgemutlu.com/">Bilge Mutlu</a> as a research assistant. I was also a Tutor at the <a href="https://math.wisc.edu/undergraduate/mlc/">Math Learning Center</a>, mentoring Pre-calculus and Calculus courses.</p>

<p>I snowboarding, kayaking and trying to learn scuba diving now in southern california, I find that spending time in nature is rejuvenating and offers a fresh perspective on problem-solving and creativity. I also do a lot of drawings when I am free.</p>
