<p>Welcome! I'm currently a Master's student in Data Science at the University of California, San Diego. My research and personal projects are now focused on <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Voice Recognition</strong>. I am also interested in working on projects applying machine learning on <em>nature, ecology and human</em>.</p>



<p>Before UCSD, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. My academic focuses on <strong>graph theory</strong> and <strong>geometry</strong>. At UW, I worked as a research assistant in the <a href="https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/">People and Robots Laboratory</a>, contributing to human-robot interaction research under the mentorship of <a href="https://vision.wisc.edu/staff/yaxin_hu/">Yaxin Hu</a> and Prof. <a href="http://bilgemutlu.com/">Bilge Mutlu</a>. I also tutored Pre-Calculus and Calculus at the <a href="https://math.wisc.edu/undergraduate/mlc/">Math Learning Center</a>. </p>

<p>When I’m not coding or training models, you’ll probably find me out snowboarding, kayaking, or figuring out how not to freak out while scuba diving off the SoCal coast. I like being outside when I have time. Nature helps me reset and think clearer. I also like to draw when I’ve got time, usually stuff inspired by the places I’ve been or things I remember.</p>
