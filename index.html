    <p>Welcome! I'm currently a Master's student in Data Science at the University of California, San Diego. My research and personal projects are now focused on Machine Learning and Voice Recognition. I’m also interested in applying machine learning to <em>nature, ecology, and human-centered problems</em>.</p>

    <p>Before UCSD, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. My academic interests were mainly in graph theory and geometry. At UW, I worked as a research assistant in the <a href="https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/">People and Robots Laboratory</a>, contributing to human-robot interaction research under the mentorship of <a href="https://vision.wisc.edu/staff/yaxin_hu/">Yaxin Hu</a> and Prof. <a href="http://bilgemutlu.com/">Bilge Mutlu</a>. I also tutored Pre-Calculus and Calculus at the <a href="https://math.wisc.edu/undergraduate/mlc/">Math Learning Center</a>.</p>

    <p>When I’m not coding or training models, you’ll probably find me out snowboarding, kayaking, or trying not to panic while scuba diving off the SoCal coast. Nature helps me reset and think clearer. I also like to draw in my free time, usually scenes inspired by places I’ve been or memories I want to keep.</p>

  <p>From recognizing bird calls in the wild to predicting wildfire vegetation types using 3D scans, my projects explore real-world machine learning applications. Here's a glimpse:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bird Call Recognition</strong> – Audio-based species classification using spectrograms and deep learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Wildfire Tree Modeling</strong> – Tree species prediction using LiDAR and field-collected forestry data.</li>
    <li><strong>Graph-Based Movie Recommender</strong> – Neo4j-powered engine combining metadata and behavior.</li>
  </ul>
