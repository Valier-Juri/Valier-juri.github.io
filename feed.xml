<p>I’ve just finished a big update to my personal website, and I’m really excited about how it turned out. The main focus was making the site much more enjoyable to use on mobile, along with adding full support for dark mode.</p>

<p>For a while, I noticed that browsing on a phone felt a little clunky: the layout didn’t always scale well, text could look cramped, and the navigation wasn’t as smooth as I wanted it to be. After spending some time rethinking the design, I’ve reworked the mobile experience so it feels lighter, cleaner, and more natural when you’re scrolling on a small screen.
Another big addition is dark mode. If your device is set to use it, the site will now follow along :)</p>

<p>This update has been in the works for a while, and it feels like a big step toward a more modern and comfortable browsing experience. Since I create another web app this summer, I’ve learned a lot from that experiences on UIUX and web design. Of course, I’ll keep improving things over time. There are still features I want to add, like better image handling and maybe even PWA support down the line.</p>

<p>If you run into anything odd while browsing, or if you have ideas for making the site even better, I’d love to hear your feedback.</p>

I’m excited to start sharing my journey in data science, machine learning, and the various projects I’m working on.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>

<p>In this blog, I’ll be writing about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Science Projects</strong>: My work on machine learning models, data analysis, and insights</li>
  <li><strong>Academic Journey</strong>: Experiences as a Master’s student at UCSD</li>
  <li><strong>Personal Projects</strong>: Side projects and experiments I’m working on</li>
  <li><strong>Life Lessons</strong>: Thoughts on balancing work, study, and personal interests</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="recent-work">Recent Work</h2>

<p>I’m currently focused on voice recognition and applying machine learning to ecological problems. It’s fascinating how we can use technology to better understand and protect our natural world.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!</p>]]></content><author><name>Manlin Zhang</name></author><category term="General" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to my new blog where I'll be sharing thoughts on data science, machine learning, and life experiences.]]></summary></entry></feed>
