Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to start sharing my journey in data science, machine learning, and the various projects I'm working on.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

- **Data Science Projects**: My work on machine learning models, data analysis, and insights
- **Academic Journey**: Experiences as a Master's student at UCSD
- **Personal Projects**: Side projects and experiments I'm working on
- **Life Lessons**: Thoughts on balancing work, study, and personal interests

## Recent Work

I'm currently focused on voice recognition and applying machine learning to ecological problems. It's fascinating how we can use technology to better understand and protect our natural world.

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
